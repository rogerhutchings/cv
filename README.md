## About this project

This is built from my Harp boilerplate, [hb-rog](https://github.com/rogerhutchings/hb-rog). Earlier versions used Jekyll, but a Javascript-only environment seems neater. Styling is taken care of with Stylus, and the whole thing is compiled (with asset busting) and deployed to Amazon S3.
